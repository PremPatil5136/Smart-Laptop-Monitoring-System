## 🚨 Files NOT Pushed to GitHub

**The following files/folders are excluded from this repository for security and best practices:**

### 🔒 Security Files (NEVER COMMIT!)
- `Backend/serviceAccountKey.json` - Firebase private keys
- `firebase-adminsdk-*.json` - Firebase admin credentials  
- `android/app/google-services.json` - Firebase config with API keys
- `.env` - Environment variables with secrets

**Why?** Exposing these = Anyone can access your database, steal data, or rack up bills!

### 📦 Dependencies & Build Files
- `Backend/venv/` - Python virtual environment (3000+ files, system-specific)
- `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc` - Python cache (auto-generated)
- `.dart_tool/`, `build/` - Flutter build files (auto-generated)

**Why?** Too large, platform-specific, and can be recreated easily.

### 🔧 Setup Instructions for New Developers

1. **Get Firebase Credentials:**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Download `serviceAccountKey.json` → Place in `Backend/`
   - Download `google-services.json` → Place in `android/app/`

2. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
   cd Backend
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run Flutter App:**
```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
```
